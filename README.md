## Installation
It's supposed here that conda is already installed. We'll create a new conda env :

 - `conda create -n transformers_application python=3.9.18 anaconda`
 - `conda activate transformers_application`
 - `pip install torch transformers`

 ## Project
This project was carried out as part of the APST2 course in the MATHAPPLI option. The aim is to understand a research paper by making a presentation of it and adding an illustrated example based on a personal code.
